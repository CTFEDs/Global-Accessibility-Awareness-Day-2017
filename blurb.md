# Global Accessibility Awareness day workshop

It's that time of year again! This month at CTFEDs we're going to focus on accessibility and take part in [Global Accessibility Awareness Day](http://www.globalaccessibilityawarenessday.org/) (which is on Thursday, May 18 2017).

## About the workshop

New this year: we're going to get a bit more hands-on with extra practical exercises and tutorials, and start digging at our own stuff to find the bits we can make more accessible.

New this year: we'll be doing the [GAAD activities](http://www.globalaccessibilityawarenessday.org/participate.html) again, but with an additional focus on [why we should care](https://ctfeds.github.io/Global-Accessibility-Awareness-Day-2017/activities/). We'll go mouseless / trackpadless, we'll bump up our font sizes, we'll check for colour contrast, and more.

Same this year: we'll be talking about a wider definition of disability (it's about much more than just about blind users with screen readers) and making a case for adopting Inclusive Design as an awesome way to build things for the web.

## About you

- You should be familiar with HTML and CSS.
- A little knowledge of JavaScript will be useful, but isn't required.
- You're interested in making your web stuff work for more people.

If you have one, bring your **laptop**, **charger**, and a pair of **headphones**.

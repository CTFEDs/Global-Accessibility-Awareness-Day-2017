This is based heavily on [Participate in Global Accessibility Awareness Day](http://www.globalaccessibilityawarenessday.org/participate.html). These activities help us use the web as people with disabilities do, and see if we can help make our sites and apps better for them.

**Disability** can be defined as the conflict between **Ability** (the functional capability of a person) and a **Barrier** (a problem created by a product). We can find these barriers and remove them, or avoid putting them there in the first place, opening up our sites and apps to more people.

## Go Mouseless / Trackpadless

People with physical disabilities use a keyboard instead of a mouse as it doesn’t require precise movements.

* Is there a visible focus indicator (i.e., do you know where you are) at all times as you navigate each screen using the tab and shift tab keys?
* Are you able to interact with every element that receives focus using the keyboard alone?
* If there is any element that provides functionality if you hover over it with your mouse, such as revealing a tooltip or a set of actions, can you display this strictly using the keyboard alone?

## Enlarge Your Fonts

People with visual disabilities enlarge their fonts or use a zoom tool so that text is more readable.

* Check that your page(s) is accessible and usable for low vision/visually impaired users.
* Resize the text to 200 percent. Make sure there is no loss of content or functionality.
* Have all elements resized, including all widgets?

## Check for Sufficient Color Contrast, and for Colour Blindness compatibility.

People with visual disabilities and those with colour blindness need information that has sufficient colour contrast and information that isn’t represented only in colour.

## Check Order of Elements

People with visual disabilities that use screen readers hear the page in the order of the HTML source of the page. People with cognitive disabilities need clear and consistent presentation of information.

* Check your Page(s) to make sure elements will be read by screen readers in the correct order.
* Disable the page's stylesheets and compare the order of elements before and after.

## Surf The Web With A Screen Reader

Blind people use screen readers to surf the web. Some people want to hear information as well as read it, such as those with visual or cognitive disabilities.

Try a different Operating System to your usual one. Maybe someone sitting at your table has a computer or phone that's different to yours?

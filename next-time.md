For the next one, think about these things.

- Add a separate slide for the equation.
- GAAD activities: break them down. One activity at a time, one per slide.
- Remove the resources "activity"
- Mention at the start that resources, slides, etc, are (already) up on the web.
- Make sure there's a short review activity after each piece.
- Mark jargon / tech-y language and be sure to explain each one.
- Idea for a meetup: trip to Cape Tow Society Blind and see Adrian for Screen Reader lessons.
- Look at https://empathyprompts.net/ for exercises.
- Look at https://aerolab.co/blog/web-accessibility/ for exercises.
- Look at posters in print-for-wall/posters
